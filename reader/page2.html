    <P>  Memes are not a new concept. Every fashion trend, each new slang term, anything that influenced or reformed a person or a group because of the sheer fact that it was “popular” is a meme. Coined by Richard Dawkins from DNA research and the word “memetics”, memes are behaviors, ideas, or styles in popular culture that spread from person to person. However, this spread of pop culture has taken on a new medium, the Internet. Now, instead of spreading ideas, concepts, and behaviors through television, printed media, or word of mouth, we use websites. We make videos. We compose graphics. We have upgraded our environment to that of the technological world, and have consequently proceeded to reproduce our culture there.

<span class="rollover google">'MEME' OR.. 'ME-ME' ??</span>
          <p>  Personally, I first encountered Internet memes on social networking sites such as Facebook, Tumblr, Reddit, YouTube and Twitter. Typically comedic or satirical in style, the audience for the phenomenon tends to be that of the younger, Internet savvy generations that spread ideas through mixed media on their personal blogs. The content often varied; from political to ridiculous, memes popularize an assortment of different things. With the advent of the Internet age, and the new services it provides, like message forwarding, text and instant messaging, and the heightened use of social networking sites, memes, and with them, opinions, expressions, and ideas are much more quickly spread.
</p>
          <p>  Though some Internet memes express political ideology, cultural phenomena, or societal movements, most are less poignant, taking on parody, imitation, and manipulation to get a point across. Whatever form they take, they are typically an expression of the self or of a group, and thus provide a rich view into the culture of the very Internet itself, causing some social researchers to question if their place in other areas of our world. Where they are created, and how to ensure their popularity, however, is the real mystery behind memes. Typically based on opinion, and wholly reliant on their web-based audience to gain popularity, there is no exact science in determining which new meme will rise to fame next, as no one can determine what the audience will take to. Further, due to the rapidity of the Internet, and the accessibility to some sites that make it easy to create new memes, (such as memegenerator.net), it is hard to trace the rise to fame of a certain meme, as it can spread so rapidly through the channels of the Internet from it’s point of origin.</P>
<span class="rollover hipsters">'But are they cool??'</span>
      <p>      Memes themselves can vary in form. Videos such as the “Rickrolling” meme came to popularity as a prank on YouTube.  The video, usually titled as something attention grabbing, would typically appear in the “suggested videos” sidebar of the site, and once clicked, would redirect you instead into Rick Astley’s music video for his song “Never Gonna Give You Up”. This trend, called “Rickrolling” grew to popularity, culminating in an April Fool’s Day joke by the moderators of YouTube in 2008, when they masked several “Rickrolling” videos as the “featured videos” on the site. Other memes can be represented as images or graphics with captions. The meme “LOLcats” grew to popularity in this way, featuring several candid and humorous pictures of cats with text featuring poor spelling and strange phrasing superimposed on top of them. Sent often through emails, these were clearly meant more as a joke than to inform. Other memes are just graphics re-represented in other situations, such as the “Pepper Spraying Cop”. At a UC Davis peaceful protest in November 2011, a police officer was photographed casually pepper spraying several students participating in the protest. To make this event more known, and in the spirit of parody, his image was quickly photoshopped, and re-represented throughout art, film, and history, pepper spraying various subjects from the The Beatles walking across Abbey Road to the Mona Lisa. In making this meme so popular, the deeds of the officer were condemned internationally, and a new interest in the “Occupy” movement was created.

        <p>    Due to their obvious popularity, and seeming permanence, Internet memes are now a subject studied at a social level. The way they influence thought, are influenced by current events and popular culture, shape speech, and entertain mass audiences has proved that memes have a significant societal impact, especially among the lives and culture of the young. They have become almost an extension of Walter Ong’s “second orality”, providing a new venue for Internet-era communication, as they are passed back and forth, utilized, referenced, and infused into everyday language just as often as regular speech. Their obvious influence has not gone unnoticed in other areas of society as well. Advertising experts picked up on the trend that Internet memes can create quickly, and have begun utilizing them for their products just as fast. These ad tactics have inspired such popular memes like the “Old Spice Guy”, originating from an Old Spice commercial, that has since spawned several parodies and references. These memes, though satirical, create a new place for advertisers to generate interest in their products, giving memes yet another reason to stick around in the future.

          <p>  Internet memes are a somewhat difficult concept to grasp. Ranging from jokes about cats with poor spelling, to bad music videos produced by talentless 13-year olds, to graphics making social comments masked in parody, their genres are indeterminable, and one can never predict what form they will take next. Essentially a form of self-expression, they provide a rich look into the ever-developing culture of the Internet environment. Wide spread, and fame inducing, they can decide what we, as the users of the Internet, care about next, and have the power of taking the smallest of events and bringing them to light. Though they are a somewhat new occurrence, and have the tendency to stray towards the comical, Internet memes should not be in any way discounted, as their impact on modern society is an unprecedented occurrence.

    This source delved into top memes of the last couple of years, explaining their social impact and origins. It also explained why we should care about memes, the science of them, and the financial and social impact that each new meme could potentially create. It was highly informative and seemingly unbiased, and proved a pivotal site to look back to in my research.

Gil, Paul. "What Is an Internet Meme? What Are Examples of Modern Internet Memes?" About.com: Internet for     Beginners. About.com. Web. 23 Apr. 2012. <http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/weirdwebculture/f/What-Is-an-Internet-    Meme.htm>.
    This source provided a lot of basic facts about Internet memes. Intended for users who are less familiar with the internet than others, they explain in the most basic of terms, what a meme is, its background, its usage, and gives examples of some common ones. Since it was for beginners, the content was a bit dumbed down, but it still proved very useful.

"Internet Meme." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 24 Apr. 2012. Web. 24 Apr. 2012.     <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme>.
    This website provided the bulk of the information I needed for my research. It went most into depth about memes and their history, the inspiration behind them, and provided links to other Wikipedia articles and sites that gave examples of popular memes and/or where those memes and other memes originated. It gave a base of general information that I was able to center the rest of my research on.

"Meme." Oh Internet. Oh Internet Forums. Web. 27 Apr. 2012. <http://ohinternet.com/Meme>.
    This source seemed to be like the one I am creating now, and therefore provided a lot of good information. It focused a great deal on the history of memes, providing a pretty in depth backstory that was very useful in my understanding of memes.Though it provided good information on the history of memes, I relied on this site a little less when it came to researching for my paper, because a lot of the information I found here I also found on other, more detailed sites.

Tufnell, Nicholas. "What Are Internet Memes?" The Huffington Post. The Huffington Post, 23 Jan. 2012. Web. 27 Apr.         2012. <http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/nicholas-tufnell/internet-memes-definition_b_1222906.html>.
    This source provided a lot of useful information on the importance of memes and their societal impact. It really opened my eyes to the usefulness (usually unintentional) of memes, and how they can make the most unusual people famous. It also helped me to see the usefulness of memes in a business sense- how they can be cultivated to promote a product, yet still provide for that extra punch of parody in the interim.
