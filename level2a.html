<h2>We,	 the undersigned, are graphic designers, art directors and visual communicators
who have been raised in a world in which the techniques and apparatus of advertising
 have persistently been presented to us as the most lucrative, effective and desirable
 use of our talents.</h2>

 <em> <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many design teachers and<br>
	   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mentors promote this belief; <br>
		 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the market rewards it; a tide<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of books and publications<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reinforces it.</h3></em>

			recreational vehicles. Commercial work has always paid the bills, <br><br>
			but many graphic designers have now let it become, in large measure,<br><br>
			 what graphic designers do. This, in turn, is how the world perceives <br><br>
			 design. The professionâ€™s time and energy is used up manufacturing<br><br>
		 demand for things that are inessential at best.</li>
